### 📌 Overview

---

The **Black-Scholes** Analysis project is a Python-based implementation of one of the most influential models in financial mathematics: the Black-Scholes-Merton model. Developed in 1973 by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton, this model revolutionized the pricing of European-style options and laid the foundation for modern quantitative finance.

This repository provides a structured, intuitive, and extensible platform to understand and apply the Black-Scholes model in practice. It not only calculates theoretical prices for European call and put options but also explores and analyses how these prices varry with respect to various market parameters such as volatility, interest rate, time to maturity, and strike price.

By leveraging Python’s scientific ecosystem, particularly libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, the project offers:

- A clear, conceptual, and concise implementation of the core mathematical formulas.

- Analytical tools to study the behavior of options under different conditions.

- Visualization modules that permit users to graphically interpret and analyse option sensitivity.

- A framework that can be easily expanded to include advanced topics such as:

   - Option Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, Rho)

   - Implied volatility estimations

   - Real-world option data ingestion

   - Monte Carlo simulations (for future versions)

This project is designed for:

- Quant enthusiasts, seeking a deeper and clear understanding of derivative pricing.

- Quantitative analysts and finance folks who want a quick tool for modeling.

- Researchers and developers building and modeling financial applications or trading strategies.

By outlining and explaining both theoretical depth and practical code, this repository bridges the gap between academic finance and real-world quantitative modeling.

### 📚 Mathematical Background

---

The Black-Scholes-Merton model is one of the foundational models in quantitative finance. It provides a theoretical estimate of the price of European-style call and put options, assuming that the price of the underlying asset follows a **geometric Brownian motion** with constant volatility and interest rate.

The model assumes the following stochastic differential equation for the underlying asset price `S`:

    dS = μSdt + σSdz

Where:
- `μ` is the expected return of the asset,
- `σ` is the volatility (standard deviation of returns),
- `dz` represents a standard Wiener process (Brownian motion).


Under the risk-neutral measure, the Black-Scholes formula for the price of a **European Call Option** is:

    Call Price (C) = S * N(d1) - K * e^(-rT) * N(d2)

For a **European Put Option**, the formula is:

    Put Price (P) = K * e^(-rT) * N(-d2) - S * N(-d1)

Where:
- `S` = Current price of the underlying asset
- `K` = Strike price
- `T` = Time to expiration (in years)
- `r` = Risk-free interest rate (annualized)
- `σ` = Volatility of the underlying asset
- `N(x)` = Cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution

And `d1` and `d2` are calculated as:

    d1 = [ ln(S / K) + (r + σ² / 2) * T ] / (σ * √T)
    d2 = d1 - σ * √T


### Key Assumptions of the Black-Scholes Model:
- The market is frictionless (no taxes or transaction costs).
- No arbitrage opportunities.
- The asset pays no dividends during the option's life.
- Volatility and interest rates are constant.
- The underlying follows a continuous geometric Brownian motion.
- Options can only be exercised at expiration (European-style).


The results of the Black-Scholes model form the basis for pricing and hedging strategies in options markets and remain widely used in theoretical and practical finance today.

| **Theta (Θ)** | -[S₀ × φ(d₁) × σ / (2√T) + r × K × e^(–rT) × N(d₂)]           | -[S₀ × φ(d₁) × σ / (2√T) – r × K × e^(–rT) × N(–d₂)]             |
| **Rho (ρ)**   | K × T × e^(–rT) × N(d₂)                                       | –K × T × e^(–rT) × N(–d₂)                                        |
